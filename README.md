## Overview

This repository showcases a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed for online shopping and event ticketing. The platform enables users to list and sell products, track earnings, create events, sell tickets, and purchase tickets directly within the app. Additionally, it features a built-in ticket scanner and integrates MTN MoMo as a payment method.

The application was developed by modifying and adapting the Unic – NFT Marketplace HTML Mobile Template. The simplicity of its elements allowed for extensive customization to create a solid and functional platform. A robust backend was built from scratch using Laravel to ensure seamless communication between all components and the database. This project presented both challenges and exciting learning opportunities.
